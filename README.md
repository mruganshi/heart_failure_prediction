# Heart Failure Prediction

## Description

- a Machine Learning Prediction model to build the best model for correctly predicting heart failure and building simple web applications which use Machine Learning algorithm to predict the heart condition of a person by providing some inputs.
- Trained the model with various classifiers like Decision Tree classifier, Random Forest classifier, Gradient boosting classifier and KNN after applying dimensionality reduction techniques with hyperparameter tuning.

## Technologies used:
 - Python
 - Pandas
 - Numpy
 - Matplotlib
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Flask

##Deployment

- Built a Flask API endpoint that was hosted on a local webserver. The API endpoint takes in a request with a list of values and readings of various attributes needed to predict whether there are chances of heart diesease or not for a person and returns an estimated price.
- After entering details, heart failure prediction will be visible.
